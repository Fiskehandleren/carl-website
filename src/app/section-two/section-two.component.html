          I currently work at <strong>Danske Bank</strong> as a student assistant in their Market Quants department. Here I mainly work
          on the in-house, nightly batch pipeline framework. <br>
          Previously, I worked as a student software engineer in the bank's anti-money-laundering platform, and as an IT student at <strong>GreenMobility</strong>.
